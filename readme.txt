Project Description:
The name of my project is “8 Ball Pool.” It will be an online billiard game where the player can either take turns and play against another friend, do skill challenges, or play against an AI opponent. The game will follow standard billiard game rules for both multiplayer and single player. For the skill challenge, the player must get all the red balls in the pockets in the shortest time possible, any other ball he makes is a penalty.

How to run:
The user should the main file (tp_8ball_sandreu.py) in an editor. Once he does that, the game should be able to run as long as he has 'cmu_112_graphics.py' and all the attached files in the same folder.

Libraries needed to be installed:
None

List of shortcut commands:
There are two shortcut commands. The first one is that you can shoot any ball by just clicking and dragging. And the second is that you can speed up and change the angle of a ball in the board using the arrows in the keyboard.
